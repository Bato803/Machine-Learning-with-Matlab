## Introduction

This is one of the most popular Machine Learning online course, and it's also the starting point of my Machine Learning adventure. It covers broadly the basic concepts and algorithms in Machine Learning. 

## What I want to say

I took this course probably about 2-3 years ago when I was in China. At that time Coursera is still providing free online courses and this course is one of my favourite because its vivid way of demonstration. Earlier this year, I transfered my previous session credit and got a certificate for this course. This is a very useful course, even now sometimes I would come back to check out some of the fundemental concepts. 

## Programming Assignmet

The algorithms and applications that we implemented are listed below. In each folder, there is a README file demonstring the 
implementation step by step. I tried to make it as clear as possible so that people can understand what we have done.
