# Machine-Learning-with-Matlab
**Introductory level Machine Learning**

Instructor: Andrew Ng

## Introduction

This is one of the most popular Machine Learning online course, and it's also the starting point of my Machine Learning adventure. It covers broadly the basic concepts and algorithms in Machine Learning. 

## What I want to say

I took this course probably about 2-3 years ago when I was in China. At that time Coursera is still providing free online courses and this course is one of my favourite because its vivid way of demonstration. Earlier this year, I transfered my previous session credit and got a certificate for this course. This is a very useful course, even now sometimes I would come back to check out some of the fundemental concepts. 

## Programming Assignmet

The algorithms and applications that we implemented are listed below. In each folder, there is a README file demonstring the 
implementation step by step. I tried to make it as clear as possible so that people can understand what we have done.

## Regularized Linear Regression

In the mini-project, we implement regularized linear regression and use it to play with bias-variance property. 
The task is to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

## Neural Network

In this mini-project, I implement the backpropagation algorithm for 
fully connected neural network and apply it to the task of hand written digit recognition.

## Support Vector Machine

In this mini-project, we will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier. 

## K-means and PCA

In this mini-project, we will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.
In the second part, we will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

## Anomaly detection and Recommendation System

In this mini-project, we will implement anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, we will use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
